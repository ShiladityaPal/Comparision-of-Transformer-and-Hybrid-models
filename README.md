# A Comparative Study of Transformer-Based Models and Hybrid Approach

A PyTorch-based implementation of the Transformer architecture, focused on self-attention for sequence modeling tasks. This project builds the model from scratch to provide an educational and customizable version of the Transformer, suitable for NLP or time-series data.

## Features

* Encoder-decoder Transformer architecture
* Scaled dot-product attention
* Multi-head self-attention
* Positional encoding (sinusoidal)
* Layer normalization and residual connections
* Configurable number of heads, layers, and hidden dimensions
* Trained using synthetic or real sequence data

## Model Overview

This implementation follows the architecture introduced in [Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), with core modules including:

* Positional Encoding: Adds information about token position to input embeddings.
* Multi-Head Attention: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
* Feed-Forward Networks: Applied after attention for each token.
* Residual Connections: Help gradients flow through the network.
* Layer Normalization: Stabilizes training.

## Example Use Case

You can use this Transformer for various tasks:

* Sequence-to-sequence modeling
* Language modeling
* Time-series prediction
* Educational visualization of attention mechanics
